* Capability to read remote resources as data source using URI notation.
The URI syntax is documented, and the program takes you to the right web page for help. 
You can include ftp with user name and password, and a lot of other things - 
anything that is a valid URI and that the site where it resides will actually allow you to download.
For example, if you want to process an Enron file from EDRM site, you just give it URI as
http://duaj3yp6waei2.cloudfront.net/edrm-enron-v2_bailey-s_pst.zip
and FreeEed downloads the file.
